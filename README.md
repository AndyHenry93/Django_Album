# Django_PhotoAlbum
[project Url](https://web-production-2f89.up.railway.app)

Django application where users have the ability to create an account to manage Albums and upload images. I created the user registration system with functions, more in-depth models with functions and foreign keys, and used white noise to handle static files. This project also introduced me to aws s3 buckets for storing and managing media files.
